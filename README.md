# UFOs

## Overview

### Background
In this module, we work with Dana who is a Data Journalist who wants to write about UFO sightings. She has a Javascript file that is filled with data that includes the Date, City, State, Country, and Shape of the UFOs. We use Javascript, html, bootstrap, and CSS to display the data that Dana has in a tidy Dynamic Webpage. The webpage takes in user input and filter the Data based on Date.

### Purpose
In the module challenge, we provide more in-depth analysis of UFO-sightings by allowing users to filte table for multiple criterias including Date, City, Country, State, and Shape. 

## Results
To perform a search on the webpage, Dana simply has to input a value in one or multiple fields.
For example, if I put the shape as sphere in the 'Shape' search box, it gives me the following results:

If you search for 'fresno' in the city field, you will get the following results:

If you search for 'jasper' and 'sphere' in the city and shape field simultaneously, you will get the results in the picture below:

## Summary
One drawback of this webpage is that the users have to look through the table before they start searching for specific shapes or countries because the table only consists of data from the US and the user might try search a country different than that. For the shape, there are shapes like 'formation' and 'light' in the table that the user migth not be aware of. Additionally, data in the City, State, Country, and Shape fields is all lowercase which might throw some users off as they will not get results if they put in anything capitalized. 


For further development, I would recommend that Dana should look into fixing the capitalization of the City, State, Country, and Shape fields and introduce a feature in which the user can search up the word like 'El Cajon' instead of having to search 'el cajon'and still get the desired results.

Dana can also introduce a feature in which the user can search for a sigting for the entire month using '1/2010' or '8/2013' instead of having to use the exact date since there might be more than one sighting in a month and the user wants to see the data on that.
